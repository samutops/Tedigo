Tedigo is a gTalk client written using Python, GTK+ and the XMPP python library XMPPPY.

It's just an introductory application which aims to show how the XMPP protocol can be used aside with Python and a GUI.

For running Tedigo make sure you have the following packages installed:

	- Python >= 2.7
	- GTK+ >= 2.24
	- python-glade2
	- python-xmpp

Then run:
	python app.py

In version 0.7 Tedigo is able to show the contact list, where you can choose any contact and start talking to him. Smileys are also supported.
